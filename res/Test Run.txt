Game Rules:
1. A Human-controlled player can move from the space they are currently in to a neighboring space. This represents a turn.
2. A Human-controlled player can pick up an item in the world found in the same space, removing it from the world. Limited by carry capacity. This represents a turn.
3. A Human-controlled player can look around, to see information about visible spaces. This represents a turn.
4. A Human-controlled player can make an attemp to kill the target character. This represents a turn.
5. A Computer-controlled player randomly chooses an action but always chooses to make an attempt to kill(if possible as per the game rule mentioned in point 8). This represents a turn.
6. Computer-controlled players attempt using the item in their inventory that does the most damage if unseen.
7. A player with no items can poke the target character's eye for 1 point of damage.
8. A player can only make an attemp on target character if they are in the same room, the pet is not present in that room, and if the last turn is not a look around. 
9. The target character moves around the world during every turn of the game and so does the pet.
10. If an attack is seen by another player, it is stopped, and no damage is done.
11. Unseen attacks are always successful, reducing health points of target character based on the item used and removing that item from the world.
12. The game ends when:
    a. A player successfully kills the target character, winning the game.
    b. The maximum number of turns is reached, and the target character escapes, hence nobody wins.
